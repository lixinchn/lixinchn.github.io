title: Top K. Python

### Algorithm

Give you an unsorted array.

Each time, the mission is find the position of first element in array. When position is determined, left part is smaller than the element, right part is larger than the element.

If the position returned is smaller than k, repeat the step with right part until position returned is equal to k.
If the position returned is larger than k, repeat the step with left part until position returned is equal to k.

### Python Code

```python
import random


class TopK():
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = [10, 14, 73, 25, 23, 13, 27, 94, 33, 39, 25, 59, 65, 82, 45]

    def do(self, k):
        k = k - 1
        low, high = 0, len(self.data) - 1
        while True:
            index = self.partition(self.data, low, high)
            if index < k:
                low = index + 1
                continue
            if index > k:
                high = index - 1
                continue
            return self.data[index]

        
    def partition(self, data, low, high):
        flag = low
        while low <= high:
            while low <= high and data[low] <= data[flag]:
                low += 1
            while low <= high and data[high] >= data[flag]:
                high -= 1
            if low > high:
                data[high], data[flag] = data[flag], data[high]
                return high
            data[low], data[high] = data[high], data[low]
        return -1


if __name__ == '__main__':
    tk = TopK()
    ret = tk.do(7)
    print ret
```
